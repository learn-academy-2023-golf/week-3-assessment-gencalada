<!-- this was actually pretty fun! so the first thing I did was read the code in its entirety. As soon as I saw the array everything from the html title tag to the const names all led to a card generator of sorts. Then narrowing down to the set of code we needed to focus on, I noticed buttons labeled "Click to Draw a Card" and "Return Cards and Shuffle Deck" which solidified my reasoning. The next thing I noticed were the red scribble lines under the code. Before attempting anything else, I rearranged the button closing tags onto the same line as their respective opening. After, I dragged the html file onto chrome and noticed nothing was displaying other than a white screen. refreshing a few times, i went to inpect the page and saw there was an error pointing to the first button. focusing more on the buttons, I noticed the onClick for the "Click to Draw a Card" button wasnt set to anything so I went back and referred to the the consts made and set it to "drawCard". As I did that, I noticed a syntax error on the second onClick button which was the "c" on onClick was lowercase instead of upercase. going back to the page, it was still a blank white screen, so i inspected again and noticed a message stating the given code needed to be enclosed in closing tags (I cant remember exactly what it said). Remembering the exact instance my partner and i were in when creating the dice roll challenge, I cut and pasted the code within the first and second Div tags. after doing that, i went back to the page and it was finally displaying content and the buttons worked perfectly! -->
